Install this globally and you'll have access to the `nengine` command anywhere on your system.

```shell
$ npm install -g nengine-cli
```

**Note:** The job of the `nengine` command is to load and run the version of nengine you have installed locally to your project, irrespective of its version.

See the [Getting Started](https://nuintun.github.io/nengine) guide for more information.
